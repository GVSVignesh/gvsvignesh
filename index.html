<ul align="left"> 
<li>reduce</li>
<li>reuse</li>
<li>recycle</li>
<li>refuse</li>           
<li>repair</li>
<li>rethink</li>
<li>reporpose</li>
<li>renovate</li>
</ul>

After my mom read my webpage she asked me a question "Vignesh, i read the news and they said that cloth masks are not that helful for people as some are attacked with the virus even after wearing the cloth masks"
Now what mom said was true and the ans for it is :-
</h1>
<h1 >N95 masks </h1>

<h1>Now for people government also had started selling washable N95 masks so that people can reuse them even after multiple times of washing.(Also wash after every one week) (These masks are even available for a resonable price)


<h1>I hope this webpage was informative and had given good suggestions  <h1>
